# flpz
Program to investigate the flexo and piezoelectric properties of materials

### What flpz offers:

1.) Ways to understand the energy surface of a unit cell
2.) Methods to calculate the evolution of piezo and flexoelectricity as the unit cell is preturbed
3.) Extended functionality to automatically generate the ground state wavefunctions and phonon dispersion curves of materials. 

### How to use flpz: 

Currently, you can only download pip locally. So put the package into a folder, open the folder, and type in the terminal "pip install ." From here, the package will be downaloaded as well as any dependencies. 
From here, you can import flpz and use as you wish!

The program in broken up into 3 sub-programs named energy, perturbations, and coupling.
